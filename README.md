This is the IntelliJ plugin that supports inserting emoji in editor using content assist.

The reason it named "Yet another" is the fact that I ([@shiraji](https://github.com/shiraji)) already released [emoji IntelliJ plugin](https://github.com/shiraji/emoji) before. And this is another way of supporting emoji insertion

## ❓ How to use it ❓

1. Type ":" and emoji name
1. Open code completion
